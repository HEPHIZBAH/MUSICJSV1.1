# MUSICJSV1.1
This is a Javascript practice when i started my Javascript classes.
it's a landing page interface built with HTML5, CSS and a little Bit of Javascript.
i was trying to mimick a music site that has a button to pause and play music.
its not a project Just a rough javascript practice.
Not Responsive but i can fix that if you want.
